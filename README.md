# N88 SpaceShooter
 A Simple Space Shooter Game Made With N88 BASIC

# About
This is a game made out of N88-BASIC by me for a video (https://www.bilibili.com/video/bv19f4y1e7y6)

basic.txt contains the program's code. (This is supposed to run in V2 mode)

N88SpaceShooter.txt is the note by me while making the game (it is written in English and Chinese mixed together)

tool.py is a simple script I used to automatically generate text files with pre-written line numbers.
